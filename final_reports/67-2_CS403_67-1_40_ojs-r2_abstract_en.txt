ชื่อโครงงาน: เกมเอาชีวิตรอดจากน้ำท่วม
ชื่อโครงงาน: The Floor is Flooding
Nowadays, games are a widely popular form of entertainment and have been adapted as an effective learning medium. 
Not only do they provide enjoyment and fun, but they also deliver knowledge in an engaging way. 
The Floor is Flooding is designed with the purpose of illustrating the differences in performance between Dijkstra's Algorithm and A. 
This allows players to enjoy the game while observing the distinct behaviors of these two algorithms in action. 
The game will be developed using the Godot Engine, a widely used tool for creating both 2D and 3D games. 
The game will follow a Tower Defense format, where players aim to defend their base by strategically placing turrets at various points to fend off enemies moving toward the base. 
There will be two types of enemies: those that navigate using Dijkstra's Algorithm and those that use A*. Players will have a limited number of resources to place their turrets, 
requiring careful planning and resource management. Additionally, the game will feature randomly occurring flood events at different locations. 
These floods will alter enemy movement paths, forcing players to adapt their strategies and respond to sudden changes in the environment.
